# Jabbeng | DevOps · Cybersecurity · AI Systems

I build and run secure, automated engineering platforms.

Based in Switzerland, I focus on:
- **DevOps & Platform Engineering**: CI/CD, IaC, observability, reliability.
- **Cybersecurity Engineering**: hardening, operational security, investigation-ready systems.
- **AI for Engineering**: practical LLM workflows to accelerate delivery and operations.

## Value delivered

- Standardized multi-workspace environments with reproducible automation.
- Security-by-default operations with continuous scanning and dependency monitoring.
- Faster execution through tooling, scripts, and AI-assisted workflows.
