# Jabbeng | DevSecOps Architect & Consultant

**Automate Everything. Secure Everything.**

I design and operate production-grade developer and security environments, with a strong focus on **automation**, **platform reliability**, and **security by default**.

Based in Switzerland, building within **SwissOneLab / SwissLabs Projects**.

## Professional focus

| Domain | Expert focus |
|---|---|
| **DevOps & Platform Engineering** | CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, operations runbooks, observability |
| **Cybersecurity Engineering** | hardening, forensics workflows, audit readiness, offensive/defensive lab operations |
| **AI for Engineering** | practical LLM integration, local AI ops (Ollama), agent-based workflows |
| **Infrastructure & Systems** | Docker ecosystem, homelab architecture, network services, secure automation |
| **Developer Experience** | reproducible environments, shell tooling, dotfiles, automation-first workflows |

## Current architecture (SwissOneLab)

- Unified workspace and profile system across Dev, Security, Infra, Business, and SRE domains.
- Standardized submodule strategy for multi-repo operations and synchronized release flow.
- Security baseline with:
  - automated dependency vulnerability alerts,
  - automated security fixes,
  - gitleaks CI secret scanning workflows.

## Working principles

- Infrastructure and security changes are versioned, reviewable, and reproducible.
- Automation over manual operations, with explicit rollback paths.
- Security controls embedded early (secrets scanning, dependency monitoring, hardened defaults).
- Documentation maintained as an operational asset, not as an afterthought.
