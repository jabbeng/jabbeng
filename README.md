# Jabbeng | DevSecOps Architect & Consultant

**Automate Everything. Secure Everything.**

Founder and platform architect behind **SwissOneLab**. I design and operate production-grade environments with a focus on **security by design**, **automation**, and **long-term architectural control**.

Based in Switzerland. Building within **SwissOneLab / SwissLabs Projects**.

## Executive positioning

- Founder-led platform vision with enterprise-grade execution
- Infrastructure and security architecture for complex environments
- AI-assisted operations integrated into controlled delivery workflows

## Professional + Enterprise

Founder-led structure with a clear separation between the public professional profile and the private enterprise build.

| Track | Repository | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **Professional** | [`jabbeng/profil`](https://github.com/jabbeng/profil) | Public-facing profile with capabilities, positioning, and consulting scope |
| **Enterprise** | [`jabbeng/swissonelab`](https://github.com/jabbeng/swissonelab) | Founder-led SwissOneLab repository in private build phase with restricted access |
| **Profile Anchor** | [`jabbeng/jabbeng`](https://github.com/jabbeng/jabbeng) | Primary public entry point and high-level overview |
| **Open-Source Footprint** | [`jabbeng/joplin`](https://github.com/jabbeng/joplin) | Public OSS contribution footprint (TypeScript ecosystem) |

## Working principles

- Infrastructure and security changes are versioned, reviewable, and reproducible.
- Automation over manual operations, with explicit rollback paths.
- Security controls embedded early (secrets scanning, dependency monitoring, hardened defaults).
- Documentation maintained as an operational asset, not as an afterthought.
